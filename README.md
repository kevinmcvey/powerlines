Project is mobile friendly but probably better viewed on a larger format screen. Source is provided here for your enjoyment and modification but, please, no professional recruitment. (The work is special, the code is a mess :)

### To build

This project was built on a pretty old version of NodeJS (v12.16.1) and Grunt (v0.4.5). Maybe it'll work with newer versions too? Regardless, building should be relatively straightforward:

```
npm install
grunt
```

The built project will be found in `dist/build.js`. The only significant dependency is [http://paperjs.org/](PaperJS).
